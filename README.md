# The Graph CLI (graph-cli)

The Graph command line interface.

As of today, the command line interface consists of two commands:

- `graph codegen` — generates TypeScript code for smart contract ABIs used in subgraphs.
- `graph build` — compiles subgraphs to WebAssembly and deploys them to IPFS.

## How It Works

`graph` takes a `subgraph.yaml` subgraph manifest with

- references to a GraphQL schema,
- smart contract ABIs, and
- mappings written in TypeScript/AssemblyScript,

compiles the mappings to WebAssembly and deploys a ready-to-use
version of the subgraph to IPFS or a local directory for debugging.

## Usage

Subgraphs for The Graph are set up just like any regular TypeScript
project. It is recommended to install `graph-cli` as a local dependency
via `package.json` and use `npm` scripts for code generation and
building.

An example of this can be found in the [Decentraland repository](https://github.com/graphprotocol/decentraland/).

1.  Create a project for the subgraph with a `package.json` etc.
2.  Add a `subgraph.yaml` subgraph manifest with a GraphQL schema etc.
3.  Add `@graphprotocol/graph-cli` as a local dependency with one of
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @graphprotocol/graph-cli # NPM
    yarn add --dev @graphprotocol/graph-cli         # Yarn
    ```
4.  Add the following `tsconfig.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "./node_modules/@graphprotocol/graph-cli/tsconfig.json",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["@graphprotocol/graph-cli"]
      }
    }
    ```
5.  Add the following to `package.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "codegen": "graph codegen subgraph.yaml",
        "build": "graph build subgraph.yaml",
        "build-ipfs": "graph build --ipfs /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001 subgraph.yaml"
        "deploy": "graph deploy --ipfs /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001 --node http://localhost:8030 --subgraph-name your-subgraph subgraph.yaml",
      }
    }
    ```
    _Note: Replace the IPFS address with any IPFS node you want to deploy the subgraph to._
6.  Generate type definitions for contract ABIs used in the subgraph
    with:
    ```bash
    yarn codegen
    ```
7.  Develop your `mapping.ts` against these generated types.
8.  Build the subgraph with one of
    ```sh
    yarn build      # Will drop the results in dist/
    yarn build-ipfs # Will also deploy to IPFS and output an IPFS hash
    ```
